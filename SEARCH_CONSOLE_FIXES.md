# Google Search Console Fixes Applied

## Issues Addressed

### ✅ 1. Alternate Page with Proper Canonical Tag (8 pages)
**Fixed by:**
- Added canonical tag to home page
- Updated sitemap to include all pages (contact, submit, privacy, terms)
- All pages now have proper canonical tags

### ✅ 2. Pages Not Yet Indexed (21 pages)
**Fixed by:**
- Updated sitemap.ts to include all static pages
- All pages now listed in sitemap at: https://pickleballatx.org/sitemap.xml

### ⚠️ 3. Page with Redirect (2 pages)
**Action needed in Google Search Console:**
- These are likely Vercel redirects (www → non-www or HTTP → HTTPS)
- This is normal and good for SEO
- No action needed - these will resolve automatically

## Next Steps for You

### In Google Search Console:

1. **Request Indexing:**
   - Go to URL Inspection tool
   - Submit main pages for indexing:
     - https://pickleballatx.org
     - https://pickleballatx.org/courts
     - https://pickleballatx.org/courts/free
     - https://pickleballatx.org/about

2. **Submit Updated Sitemap:**
   - Sitemap URL: https://pickleballatx.org/sitemap.xml
   - If already submitted, Google will automatically re-crawl
   - If new submission, go to Sitemaps section and add it

3. **Monitor Progress:**
   - Allow 24-48 hours for Google to re-crawl
   - Check "Coverage" report to see indexed pages
   - Can take up to 1 week for full indexing

   - Added canonical tag: https://pickleballatx.org

2. **app/sitemap.ts**
